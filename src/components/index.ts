// Only export what outside consumers actually need: the components themselves and their
// composed, adapter-specific prop types. Internal building blocks — adapter-common's raw
// `RecursicaXxxProps` slices, foundational types (`RecursicaOverStyled`, `WithRecursicaSpacing`,
// etc.), and helper functions (`mergeClassNames`, `wrapComponent`, etc.) — stay unexported here
// even though components use them internally; re-export one explicitly, from the file that uses
// it, only if there's a real reason an outside consumer needs it (see `markCurrentPageItem`
// in Breadcrumb for an example).

// Pass-through components that have no mantine-specific implementation — each is
// redeclared in its own components/ folder and re-exported from adapter-common there.
