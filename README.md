# @recursica/mantine-adapter

A modern React component library built with TypeScript and **Mantine 8**. This package serves as the core UI kit for Recursica applications, providing reusable UI components, centralized theme configurations, and a comprehensive Storybook environment for development.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @recursica/mantine-adapter
# or
yarn add @recursica/mantine-adapter
# or
pnpm add @recursica/mantine-adapter
```

## Peer Dependencies

This library requires the following peer dependencies to be installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @mantine/core@>=8.0.0 @mantine/dates@>=8.0.0 @mantine/hooks@>=8.0.0 react@>=16.8.0 react-dom@>=16.8.0
```

**Important**: Make sure you have these exact versions or higher installed, as the components rely on Mantine 8+ features and React 16.8+ hooks.

## Quick Start

_Components are currently being rebuilt. Documentation will be updated as new components are added._

```tsx
import React from "react";
// import { Button } from "@recursica/mantine-adapter";

function App() {
  return (
    // <Button label="Click Me" variant="solid" />
    <div>More components coming soon!</div>
  );
}
```

## Development and Architecture

This project is built using:

- **Vite (Library Mode)**: For fast builds, producing optimized ES and CJS modules.
- **Mantine 8**: Base components, hooks, and native standard styling architecture.
- **Storybook**: Used heavily for interactive component development, documentation, and prototyping.

> **Note:** We do not use Vanilla Extract or PostCSS for this project, relying instead on Mantine's built-in CSS styling and Vite's native CSS/CSS Modules capabilities. No complex CSS-in-JS overhead!

## Storybook Documentation

This library includes Storybook for all components. You can:

- **View live examples** of components.
- **Test component interactions** and accessibility.
- **Explore UI tokens** and layout utilities.

### Accessing Storybook Locally

If you're contributing or developing locally, clone the repository and run:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will spin up a local server (typically at `http://localhost:6006`) with a hot-reloading environment for component prototyping.

## TypeScript Support

All newly built components will include full TypeScript support with comprehensive prop types exported.
